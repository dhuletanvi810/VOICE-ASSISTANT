# VOICE-ASSISTANT

*COMPANY*: HEX SOFTWARE

*NAME*: TANVI DHULE

*DOMAIN*: PYTHON PROGRAMMING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: KAPTAN

*DESCRIPTION*:
This is simple voice assistant using Python on Visual Studio Code (VS Code). This project helped me understand the basics of speech recognition, text-to-speech, and how to make Python interact with audio input and output.
The voice assistant listens to the user's voice commands, recognizes the speech, processes it, and responds back using voice. The project uses libraries like:
SpeechRecognition – to convert voice to text.
pyttsx3 – for converting text back to voice (text-to-speech).
PyAudio – for handling microphone input.
I used VS Code as the main code editor for writing and running the script because it is lightweight, easy to use, and supports extensions for Python development.

Main Features:
Listens to voice input using the microphone.
Responds to basic commands like greetings, or saying something back.
Can stop itself when the user says "stop" or "exit".

Tools & Libraries Used:
Tool	Purpose
Python 3.11+	Programming Language
VS Code	Code Editor
SpeechRecognition	Converts voice to text
pyttsx3	Converts text to voice
PyAudio	Handles microphone input
pip	Used to install required libraries

Purpose of the Project:
The goal of this project was to learn how:
Python can be used in real-world applications like AI and speech.
To work with external libraries.
To debug and run code in an IDE like VS Code.
This is a beginner-friendly project and a great start for students who are interested in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
